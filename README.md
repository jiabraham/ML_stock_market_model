# ML_stock_market_model
In this tool kit there are functions to webscrape stock market articles and the price of the S&P 500. This stock market model uses Keras taking in a corpus made of these articles as features to predict the change of the S&P 500 index price in a given hour (style guide and documentation in progress).
